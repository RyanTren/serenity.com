# Software Engineering Planning Document: Web Development Project

### Project Title:

Serenity - Music Player with Friends' Favorite Songs Playlist

### Project Description:

Design and develop a music player web application that allows users to create and manage playlists containing their friends' favorite songs. The application will utilize JavaScript and TypeScript for frontend development, with ReactJS/TS for building the user interface.

## Project Objectives:

* Create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for the music player.
* Implement features to allow users to add, remove, and manage songs in playlists.
* Integrate authentication system to allow users to login and access their playlists.
* Utilize APIs to fetch and display song data.
* Implement functionality to play, pause, skip, and control volume of songs.
* Enable users to share playlists with friends and collaborate on playlist management.
* Ensure responsiveness and compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
* Implement robust error handling and validation to enhance user experience.
* Optimize performance and loading times for smooth user interaction.
* Document codebase, including comments and README.md file, for easy understanding and future maintenance.

## Project Technologies:

## Frontend Development:

JavaScript and TypeScript
ReactJS/TS
HTML5 and CSS3 (for styling)
Redux (optional for state management)
Backend Development (if required for authentication and data management):
Node.js (with Express.js)
MongoDB or Firebase (for database)

* APIs:
External APIs for fetching song data (e.g., Spotify API)

* Development Tools:
Visual Studio Code (or preferred code editor)
Git (for version control)
npm or yarn (for package management)
Figma or Adobe XD (for UI/UX design)

* Deployment:
Netlify, Vercel, or AWS for frontend deployment
Heroku, Firebase, or AWS for backend deployment (if applicable)
Project Timeline:
